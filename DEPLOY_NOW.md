Your Firebase login is working, but we need to complete the authentication. Here are your deployment options:

## Option 1: GitHub Pages (Easiest - No Setup Needed)

```bash
# Just push to GitHub - Pages auto-deploys!
git add .
git commit -m "Add AI Gesture Password System"
git push origin main

# Then go to: GitHub Settings → Pages → Enable
